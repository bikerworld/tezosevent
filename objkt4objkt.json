  "description": "We encourage you all to mint and collect OBJKTs for (almost) free. We believe that the OBJKT4OBJKT initiative helps to create a happier and healthier community within Hic et Nunc and that by removing the monetization barrier it will help other artists and collectors to discover and build a more diverse art collection.<br/>We would like to kindly remind everyone to only take 1 edition of any artwork you collect. We also suggest that artists write on their OBJKT description that itâ€™s part of the #OBJKT4OBJKT event.<br />To be included in this event page, <b>you must add \"OBJKT4OBJKT\" as a tag at mint time.",
