  "description": "The recent wildfires in Maui, Hawaii have caused immense devastation. As of August 18, the death toll was 111, with as many as 1,000 still missing. In an attempt to support relief efforts, the TezMauiAid event has been set up to direct funds to Maui Wildfire Relief through CryptoForCharity. This cause fund will distribute donations equally across these four organizations: Maui Humane Society, Convoy of Hope, Global Giving, and Pacific Whale Foundation.<br/>Artists and collectors can contribute through art sales and promotion of this fundraiser. Direct donations of XTZ are also possible.<br/>Artists, make sure to use TezMauiAid tag at mint time (not just on social media), and to redirect proceeds to the donation wallet to be visible in this event page.",
