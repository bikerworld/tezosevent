  "description": "Portals4Queers is the second act of incredible support and charity from a growing group of artists in the Tezos Community.  All artists involved will be posting their work with the hashtag #Portals4Queers. Find the art on Twitter, or click through the gallery below.<br />All proceeds from the sales of these NFTs will be donated to the Queer Museum of Digital Art (\"QMoDA\"). Half of the Tezos collected will go towards acquiring Tezos-based NFTs, and the other half will go towards the QMoDA community treasury.<br />Additionally, each artist will donate one edition of their NFT to the QMoDA Vault, where it will be permanently housed in a metaverse exhibition space.",
